The file structure consist of several folders like controllers, middlewares, models, public(contains public assets) and views(contains main template).
The Website has following features-

In the process of creating the blog website the challenges that I faced were Create, read and update in node js, user authentication among various others.
This uses Node.js along with Express.js to quickly and efficiently build the required rest API's.
